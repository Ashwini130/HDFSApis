HDFS JAVA APIs

** Following is the list of problems for which I have written Java based HDFS APIs ** <br>

1) Delete Empty Files in HDFS. 

Problem Statement : A company  generates data every hour and places them on HDFS in separate partitions. However, for the past few days, no data is getting generated, but still jobs create empty files in HDFS. This indirectly affects the Namenode memory issues as large number of irrelevant files are present in the namespace. Hence, you need to list these files and delete them one by one. You have to write the Java Utility to solve the problem.

Solution : List the files with their sizes in the given hdfs directory and delete them. 

Code : HdfsDeleteEmpty.java

2) Split Files

Problem Statement : From the given dataset, you need to separate the weather records of India , the rest of the 
world and write them into two separate files. Hence write a Java utility using Hadoop 
JavaAPI that performs the following:

Solution : 

Code : SplitFiles.java

3) Sync Utility

Problem Statement : Given Two Folders in HDFS cluster, Source and Target, write a sync utility which when executed, will sync the files in Target directory according to the files in Source directory. 

Solution : List the files of the source director and check the checksum of each file in source and target. If the checksum matches, no files need to be copied, if not, file will be copied from Source to Target directory.

Code : HdfsSyncUtility.java
